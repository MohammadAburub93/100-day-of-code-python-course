# 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp Portfolio 🐍

> **Status:** In Progress
> **Focus:** Python Programming, Algorithms, Data Analysis & Automation

## 📌 Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive archive of my journey through the **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** by Dr. Angela Yu. 

Coming from a background in **Electrical Engineering and Physics Education**, I undertook this challenge to build a rigorous foundation in software development. Over the course of 100 days, I moved from basic scripting to building complex applications involving Web Scraping, GUI Automation, API Integration, and Data Analysis.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Concepts
This portfolio demonstrates proficiency in the following areas:

* **Core Python:** OOP (Object Oriented Programming), List Comprehensions, Error Handling.
* **Data Handling:** Pandas, CSV manipulation, JSON data management.
* **Web & APIs:** Requests, BeautifulSoup (Scraping), Selenium (Automation), Flask (Basic Web Dev).
* **GUI:** Turtle, Tkinter.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The projects are delivered to demonstrate daily consistency and growth.

| Topic / Project | Key Skills |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Coffee Machine** | OOP, Resource Management, Complex Logic |
| **Turtle Crossing Game** | Class Inheritance, GUI Event Listening |
| **US States Game** | Pandas, CSV Data Analysis |
| **ISS Overhead Notifier** | API Integration, JSON Parsing |
| **Flight Deal Finder** | Advanced API, Email Notification |
| **Movie Scraper** | BeautifulSoup, HTML Parsing |

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MohammadAburub93/100-day-of-code-python-course.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a specific project:**
    ```bash
    cd Day_25_US_States_Game
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies (if a requirements file exists):**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
